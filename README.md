- Sort donations by various criteria (e.g., amount, donor name)
- Search donations based on donor name or donation amount
- Generate reports on total donations, donor statistics, etc.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)

2. Compile the `UnitedReliefProject.cpp` file.
3. Make sure the `donations.csv` file is in the same directory as the executable.
4. Run the program to interact with the donation management system.
